# BigDebuffs

BigDebuffs is an _extremely lightweight_ addon that hooks the Blizzard raid frames to increase the debuff size of crowd control effects. Additionally, it replaces unit frame portraits with debuff durations when important debuffs are present.

The addon menu can be accessed by typing /bd or /bigdebuffs.

### Downloading

To download this addon, hit the **green "Code" button** and then select `Download ZIP`.

Once the addon is finished downloading, extract the contents to your `Interface/AddOns` directory and **importantly** rename the folder from `BigDebuffs-MoP-master` to `BigDebuffs`.

### Backport Notes
* The backport is based on Legion/BfA BigDebuffs.
* The spell list is not optimized and could contain faults.  Feel free to create an issue or a pull request if you have an improvement suggestion.
* You can scale the size of the cooldown spiral with this version of the AddOn. This means you can e.g. fit it more tightly to the portrait of the unit.
